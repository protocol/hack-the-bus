// and three consumers. Two if the consumers have distinct interests, while the third consumer is
// interested in all event types. It then publishes only two events with distinct event types and
// shows a total of four events are consumed by the three consumers: one event by each of the
// consumers with distinct interest, and two events by the consumer that is interested in all event
// types.
